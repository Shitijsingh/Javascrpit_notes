/* 
Variables in Javascript 
A javascript varaible is just a name  of storage location.

and we can give that name in three ways 

Using let keywords are block scope
Using const keywords are block scope
Using let keywords are Function scope

Rule of naming of variables

A variable name can  contain any of  the following charaters but must not start with a digit

1. capital letter A to Z 
2. Small letter a to z
3. Digit: 0 to 9 (but we can't start variable name  with digits )
4. Only two special charaters that are Dollar "$" and Underscore "_"

// let username = 'Mohit';
let userIntro = 'My name is Mohit khan';
let age = 25;
let isHappy = true
let nameFirst = "Hi I am" + ' ' + username + ' ' + ".I am " + age + ' ' + "old"
let a = "Ankur"
{
    let username = "rohit"
}
const hourInDay = 22
// hourInDay = 22 is fixed once time
// console.log(userIntro)
console.log(username)
